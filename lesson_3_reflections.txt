When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on it from different locations or when other people are also working on the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not want the most recent changes on the remote repository because the changes could
introduce new bugs or new features that you are not working on.
