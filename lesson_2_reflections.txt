What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The git config files for the repo are created. This allows you to run git
commands on the files and save versions.
An empty git repo is created in the directory. Files in the directory can then
be added to the repo for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area shows you which files have changed from the current checked out
commit, and the which files out of the changed files are to be committed or not.
The staging area allows you to commit some of the files changed.
